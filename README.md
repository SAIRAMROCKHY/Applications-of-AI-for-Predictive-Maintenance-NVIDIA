## Description

According to the International Society of Automation, $647 billion is lost globally each year due to downtime from machine failure. Organizations across manufacturing, aerospace, energy, and other industrial sectors are leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning for predictive maintenance. This workshop focuses on identifying anomalies in time-series data, estimating remaining useful life, and mapping anomalies to failure conditions. Participants learn to use AI to predict equipment conditions and optimize maintenance schedules, thus minimizing costly downtime.

## Information

The goals of this workshop are:
- Use AI-based predictive maintenance to prevent failures and unplanned downtimes.
- Identify challenges in anomaly detection leading to costly breakdowns.
- Predict outcomes using XGBoost-based machine learning models for time-series data.
- Implement LSTM models for equipment failure prediction.
- Utilize autoencoders for anomaly detection with limited failure-example data.
